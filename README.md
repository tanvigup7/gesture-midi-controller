# Gesture-Based Midi Controller

**Description**
A prototype touchless music controller that allows users to manipulate audio parameters using hand gestures. Hand movements are detected via webcam and mapped to virtual knobs and sliders, enabling real-time control of volume, effects, loops, or MIDI parameters. No hardware involved. Just your laptop + camera + DAW.

**Features**
* Real time hand gesture detection (OpenCV + MediaPipe)
* Gesture to music action mapping for live control
* Virtual knobs and sliders for visual feedback
* Supports audio output via MIDI or direct synthesis (prototype)

**Notes**
* This is an early prototype. Features may not work perfectly.
* Works best with good lighting and a clear background for hand detection.
* Virtual knobs and sliders show visual feedback for gestures.

**Future Improvements**
* Add configurable gesture-to-action mapping
* Support multiple hands simultaneously
* Integrate with DAWs like Ableton or GarageBand
* Add visual/audio performance effects
